This is the inference of the trained LSTM&CNN model.
Here I predict the events for every second of the given test data. 
Since it was not specified exactly how big is the train dataset I set the counter MAX_TIME_TO_RUN to prevent that the runtime of the notebook exceeds the limits of the competition 
(maximum is 9hrs, but I set to 6 just for the example).
