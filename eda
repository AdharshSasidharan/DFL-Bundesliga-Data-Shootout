exp:
This code is importing various libraries in Python to perform data analysis, visualization, and image processing.
The 'numpy' library is used for performing mathematical operations on arrays and matrices, while 'pandas' library is used to read and manipulate datasets stored in CSV file format.
'plotly.express' library is used to create interactive and customizable visualizations of the data. 'matplotlib' library is used to create static visualizations.
The 'statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot' library is used to create mosaic plots, which are used to visualize the relationship between two categorical variables.
The 'cv2' library is used for image processing and computer vision applications.
The code is also importing the 'os' library to access the input files, which are stored in a read-only directory named "../input/".




train = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
exp:
This line of code reads a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file called 
train.csv' and stores the data in a variable called 'train'. 
The CSV file is likely to contain structured data, such as a table 
of information with rows and columns, which can be easily read and
analyzed by a computer program. The 'pd' in the code refers to a Python
library called pandas which provides a set of functions to work with data.
So, this line of code is using pandas library to read a CSV file and store the
data in a variable for further use in a Python program.

train.head()
exp:
This code is likely part of a program written in Python and it involves the use of a library called Pandas, which is often used for data analysis.
The ".head()" function is being applied to a variable called "train". This variable probably contains a table of data, also known as a dataframe. The ".head()" function is used to display the first few rows of this table, usually the top 5 rows by default.
So, this code is simply showing the first few rows of the "train" dataframe, allowing the user to quickly see what kind of data is contained in the table.

train.tail()
exp:
This code is likely written in Python and is asking to display the bottom (or last) few rows of a table or data set that is called "train".
The "train.tail()" function is a method in Python that is used to display the last few rows of a table or data set. The word "tail" is used because it refers to the end or bottom of something, similar to the tail of an animal.
So, in summary, this code is asking to display the last few rows of a data set called "train".

train.info()
exp:
This code is asking a computer program to give information about a
"train" object. The information that is returned might include things 
like the number of rows and columns in the "train" object, the data types of each column, and the amount of memory used by the "train" object. This information can be useful for understanding the data and how it is being processed by the program.

train.isnull().sum()
exp:
This code is used to count the number of missing values (null values) in a dataset.
"train" refers to a dataset that has been loaded into the program.
".isnull()" is a function that checks each value in the dataset to see if it is null or missing.
".sum()" is a function that adds up the total number of null values in each column of the dataset.
So when we write "train.isnull().sum()", the program first checks for null values in the "train" dataset using the ".isnull()" function,
and then adds up the total number of null values in each column using the ".sum()" function. The output of this code will be a list of the number 
of null values in each column of the dataset.

x=train['video_id'].value_counts()
print(x)
exp:
This code is for analyzing a dataset of videos. It counts the number of times each video ID appears in the dataset and then prints the results.
The video ID is a unique identifier assigned to each video in the dataset.
So essentially, the code counts how many times each video has been included in the dataset and outputs that count for each video.

Crosstable = pd.crosstab(train['event'], train['event_attributes'])
Crosstable.style.background_gradient(cmap='Greens')
exp:
This code is using a library called pandas to create a table that shows how often certain events occur in a dataset.
The dataset is called 'train', and the events are listed under 'event'. 
The table will also show how these events are associated with different attributes, which are listed under 'event_attributes'.
The code then adds a visual element to the table by applying a color gradient.
This gradient will highlight cells in the table that have a higher count of events in a particular category, 
making it easier to see patterns and relationships between the events and their attributes. 
The gradient used in this code is called 'Greens', which means that cells with higher counts will be shaded with shades of green, 
while cells with lower counts will be shaded with lighter greens or white.

fig_2 = px.bar(train,x='video_id',y='event',
             color='event',title = 'Event types throw videos')
fig_2.show()
exp:
This code is creating a bar chart using a Python library called Plotly Express.
The chart will show the number of events that occurred for different videos.
The x-axis will show the video ID, and the y-axis will show the number of events. 
Each bar in the chart will be colored based on the type of event that occurred.
The chart will be titled "Event types throw videos". 
Finally, the chart will be displayed on the screen using the "show" method.

import plotly.express as px
fig_3 = px.bar(train.query('event not in ["start","end"]')\
    .groupby('video_id')['event'].value_counts().unstack(),orientation='h')
fig_3.show()
exp:
This code is using a Python library called Plotly Express to create a bar chart.
The data for the chart is coming from a table or dataset called 'train'.
The first line of code is importing the Plotly Express library and giving it the nickname 'px' to make it easier to use later on.
The second line of code is creating a variable called 'fig_3', which will hold the chart.
The third line of code is telling the chart to use the 'train' dataset, but only select rows where the 'event' column does not contain the words "start" or "end".
The fourth line of code is telling the chart to group the remaining rows by 'video_id', and count how many times each value appears in the 'event' column.
The fifth line of code is telling the chart to display the counts as horizontal bars.
The sixth line of code is displaying the chart.

train.query('video_id =="1606b0e6_0"& event not in ["start","end"]')\
.groupby('event_attributes')['event'].value_counts().unstack()
exp:
This code is performing a series of operations on a data table called "train" which contains information about events related to video content.
The first line of code is selecting a subset of the data where the "video_id" column has a specific value ("1606b0e6_0") and the "event" column does not have the values "start" or "end".
The second line of code groups the remaining events by their "event_attributes" and counts the number of events for each "event" type within each "event_attributes" group.
The final line of code rearranges the results into a table where the "event" types are listed as columns and the "event_attributes" are listed as rows. This allows for easy comparison of the frequency of each event type within each event attribute.
