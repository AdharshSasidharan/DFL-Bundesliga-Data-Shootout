exp:
This code is importing various libraries in Python to perform data analysis, visualization, and image processing.
The 'numpy' library is used for performing mathematical operations on arrays and matrices, while 'pandas' library is used to read and manipulate datasets stored in CSV file format.
'plotly.express' library is used to create interactive and customizable visualizations of the data. 'matplotlib' library is used to create static visualizations.
The 'statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot' library is used to create mosaic plots, which are used to visualize the relationship between two categorical variables.
The 'cv2' library is used for image processing and computer vision applications.
The code is also importing the 'os' library to access the input files, which are stored in a read-only directory named "../input/".




train = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
exp:
This line of code reads a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file called 
train.csv' and stores the data in a variable called 'train'. 
The CSV file is likely to contain structured data, such as a table 
of information with rows and columns, which can be easily read and
analyzed by a computer program. The 'pd' in the code refers to a Python
library called pandas which provides a set of functions to work with data.
So, this line of code is using pandas library to read a CSV file and store the
data in a variable for further use in a Python program.

train.head()
exp:
This code is likely part of a program written in Python and it involves the use of a library called Pandas, which is often used for data analysis.
The ".head()" function is being applied to a variable called "train". This variable probably contains a table of data, also known as a dataframe. The ".head()" function is used to display the first few rows of this table, usually the top 5 rows by default.
So, this code is simply showing the first few rows of the "train" dataframe, allowing the user to quickly see what kind of data is contained in the table.

train.tail()
exp:
This code is likely written in Python and is asking to display the bottom (or last) few rows of a table or data set that is called "train".
The "train.tail()" function is a method in Python that is used to display the last few rows of a table or data set. The word "tail" is used because it refers to the end or bottom of something, similar to the tail of an animal.
So, in summary, this code is asking to display the last few rows of a data set called "train".

train.info()
exp:
This code is asking a computer program to give information about a
"train" object. The information that is returned might include things 
like the number of rows and columns in the "train" object, the data types of each column, and the amount of memory used by the "train" object. This information can be useful for understanding the data and how it is being processed by the program.

train.isnull().sum()
exp:
This code is used to count the number of missing values (null values) in a dataset.
"train" refers to a dataset that has been loaded into the program.
".isnull()" is a function that checks each value in the dataset to see if it is null or missing.
".sum()" is a function that adds up the total number of null values in each column of the dataset.
So when we write "train.isnull().sum()", the program first checks for null values in the "train" dataset using the ".isnull()" function,
and then adds up the total number of null values in each column using the ".sum()" function. The output of this code will be a list of the number 
of null values in each column of the dataset.

x=train['video_id'].value_counts()
print(x)
exp:
This code is for analyzing a dataset of videos. It counts the number of times each video ID appears in the dataset and then prints the results.
The video ID is a unique identifier assigned to each video in the dataset.
So essentially, the code counts how many times each video has been included in the dataset and outputs that count for each video.

Crosstable = pd.crosstab(train['event'], train['event_attributes'])
Crosstable.style.background_gradient(cmap='Greens')
exp:
This code is using a library called pandas to create a table that shows how often certain events occur in a dataset.
The dataset is called 'train', and the events are listed under 'event'. 
The table will also show how these events are associated with different attributes, which are listed under 'event_attributes'.
The code then adds a visual element to the table by applying a color gradient.
This gradient will highlight cells in the table that have a higher count of events in a particular category, 
making it easier to see patterns and relationships between the events and their attributes. 
The gradient used in this code is called 'Greens', which means that cells with higher counts will be shaded with shades of green, 
while cells with lower counts will be shaded with lighter greens or white.

fig_2 = px.bar(train,x='video_id',y='event',
             color='event',title = 'Event types throw videos')
fig_2.show()
exp:
This code is creating a bar chart using a Python library called Plotly Express.
The chart will show the number of events that occurred for different videos.
The x-axis will show the video ID, and the y-axis will show the number of events. 
Each bar in the chart will be colored based on the type of event that occurred.
The chart will be titled "Event types throw videos". 
Finally, the chart will be displayed on the screen using the "show" method.

import plotly.express as px
fig_3 = px.bar(train.query('event not in ["start","end"]')\
    .groupby('video_id')['event'].value_counts().unstack(),orientation='h')
fig_3.show()
exp:
This code is using a Python library called Plotly Express to create a bar chart.
The data for the chart is coming from a table or dataset called 'train'.
The first line of code is importing the Plotly Express library and giving it the nickname 'px' to make it easier to use later on.
The second line of code is creating a variable called 'fig_3', which will hold the chart.
The third line of code is telling the chart to use the 'train' dataset, but only select rows where the 'event' column does not contain the words "start" or "end".
The fourth line of code is telling the chart to group the remaining rows by 'video_id', and count how many times each value appears in the 'event' column.
The fifth line of code is telling the chart to display the counts as horizontal bars.
The sixth line of code is displaying the chart.

train.query('video_id =="1606b0e6_0"& event not in ["start","end"]')\
.groupby('event_attributes')['event'].value_counts().unstack()
exp:
This code is performing a series of operations on a data table called "train" which contains information about events related to video content.
The first line of code is selecting a subset of the data where the "video_id" column has a specific value ("1606b0e6_0") and the "event" column does not have the values "start" or "end".
The second line of code groups the remaining events by their "event_attributes" and counts the number of events for each "event" type within each "event_attributes" group.
The final line of code rearranges the results into a table where the "event" types are listed as columns and the "event_attributes" are listed as rows. This allows for easy comparison of the frequency of each event type within each event attribute.

import pandas as pd
sub = pd.read_csv('sample_submission.csv')
sub.head()
exp:
This code is using a programming language called Python to import a library called pandas, which helps to manipulate data.
Then, it reads a file called 'sample_submission.csv' using the 'read_csv' function provided by pandas, which creates a table-like data structure called a DataFrame.
Finally, it displays the first few rows of this DataFrame using the 'head' function, so that you can see what the data looks like.

import plotly.express as px
fig_4 = px.bar(sub,x='event',y='video_id',color = 'event',title = 'Event types and the score')
fig_4.show()
exp:
This code uses a Python package called plotly to create a bar graph.
The import plotly.express as px line tells Python to import a specific part of the plotly package, which is called express.
The next line fig_4 = px.bar(sub, x='event', y='video_id', color='event', title='Event types and the score') creates a new bar graph called fig_4. 
It uses data from the sub variable, and specifies that the x-axis should show the event column, the y-axis should show the video_id column, and the color of the bars should be based on the event column. 
It also gives the graph a title.
Finally, fig_4.show() displays the graph on the screen.

fig_5 = px.bar(sub,x='video_id',y='score',
             color='event',title = 'Score and events at each video')
fig_5.show()
exp:
This code is creating a bar graph using a Python library called Plotly Express (px). 
The data used for the graph is stored in a variable called 'sub'. 
The graph has the video IDs on the x-axis, the score on the y-axis, and different events are distinguished by color. 
The graph is given a title "Score and events at each video". 
The final line of the code "fig_5.show()" displays the graph on the screen.

sub.query('video_id =="019d5b34_0"& event not in ["start","end"]')
exp:
This code is performing a query on a dataset or table called "sub" to extract specific rows that meet certain conditions.
The condition being checked is whether the "video_id" column contains the string "019d5b34_0" and the "event" column does not contain either "start" or "end" values.
In simpler terms, the code is selecting rows from the dataset where a specific video is being watched, and where the user is not just starting or ending the video, but rather engaging with it in some other way.

def video_list(Video_Path):
    Video_IMG_List = []

    Video_Cap = cv2.VideoCapture(Video_Path)


    while Video_Cap.isOpened():


        ret,frame = Video_Cap.read()

        if ret != True:
            break

        if Video_Cap.isOpened():
            Transformation_IMG = cv2.cvtColor(frame,cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
            Resize_IMG = cv2.resize(Transformation_IMG,(180,180))
            Video_IMG_List.append(Resize_IMG)


    Video_Cap.release()
    return Video_IMG_List
exp:
This is a piece of code that takes a video file path as an input and returns a list of images that are extracted from the video.
The first thing the code does is create an empty list called Video_IMG_List.
Then it creates an object called Video_Cap that opens the video file specified in the input.
Next, the code enters a loop that will run as long as there are frames left to extract from the video.
Inside the loop, the code reads the next frame of the video using Video_Cap.read(). This returns two values: ret (short for "return value") and frame. ret is a Boolean value that indicates whether the frame was successfully read or not, and frame is the actual image data of the frame.
If ret is not True, then the end of the video has been reached and the loop is exited.
Otherwise, the code converts the color space of the frame from BGR to RGB using cv2.cvtColor(), resizes the frame to 180x180 pixels using cv2.resize(), and adds the resulting image to the Video_IMG_List using the append() method.
Once all frames have been processed, the Video_Cap object is released using Video_Cap.release(), and the list of images is returned using return Video_IMG_List.

video_file = '../Exploratory Data Analysis/test/019d5b34_0.mp4'
video_one_list = video_list(video_file)
exp:
This code is creating a variable named "video_file" which contains the file path of a video file.
The video file is located in a folder named "test" which is located in a parent directory of the current directory.
The next line of code is calling a function named "video_list" and passing the "video_file" variable as an argument to the function. 
The function is expected to return a list of items related to the video file, which will then be stored in a new variable named "video_one_list". 
The exact details of what the function does and what items are returned in the list cannot be determined without seeing the implementation of the "video_list" function.

print(np.shape(np.asarray(video_one_list)))
exp:
This code is using the Python programming language with the NumPy library to print the shape of a list called "video_one_list".
The "np.asarray" function is used to convert the "video_one_list" into a NumPy array. 
Then, the "np.shape" function is used to get the shape of the NumPy array, which gives the dimensions of the array (i.e., how many rows and columns it has).
Finally, the result is printed to the screen using the "print" function.

figure = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))

if len(video_one_list) >= 101:
    Pick_IMG = video_one_list[100]
    plt.xlabel(str(Pick_IMG.shape))
    plt.ylabel(str(Pick_IMG.size))
    plt.imshow(Pick_IMG)
else:
    print("video_one_list does not have at least 101 items.")
exp:
This code is creating a figure with a size of 8 by 8 using a library called "matplotlib.pyplot".
Then, the code is checking if a list called "video_one_list" has at least 101 items. 
If it does, the code will take the 100th item from that list and display it on the figure.
It will also print out the shape and size of that image.
If the list does not have at least 101 items, then the code will print out a message saying so.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axis = plt.subplots(4, 4, figsize=(10, 10))

if len(video_one_list) < 16:
    print("Error: video_one_list does not have enough elements.")
else:
    for i, ax in enumerate(axis.flat):
        IMG_From_List = video_one_list[i]
        ax.set_xlabel(IMG_From_List.shape)
        ax.imshow(IMG_From_List)

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
 exp:
This is a code in Python using a library called Matplotlib which allows you to create visualizations. Specifically, this code creates a grid of 4x4 images from a list of images.
The first line of code imports the Matplotlib library and renames it as "plt". This is done to make the code shorter and easier to read.
The second line of code creates a figure object and a set of subplots with a 4x4 layout, and sets the size of the figure to be 10 inches by 10 inches. This is where the images will be plotted.
The next part of the code checks if the length of a list called "video_one_list" is less than 16. If it is less than 16, it means there aren't enough images in the list to plot on the grid, and an error message will be printed.
If there are at least 16 images in the list, the code will run a loop to plot each image in the grid.
For each image in the list, the code sets a variable called "IMG_From_List" to be the current image. It then sets the x-axis label of the current subplot to be the shape of the image, and plots the image on the current subplot using the "imshow" function.
Finally, the "tight_layout" function is called to make sure the subplots are spaced out evenly, and the "show" function is called to display the grid of images.
